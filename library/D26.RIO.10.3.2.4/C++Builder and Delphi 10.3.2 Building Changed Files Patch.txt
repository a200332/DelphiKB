C++Builder and Delphi 10.3.2 Building Changed Files Patch
================================================

This patch addresses the following issues:

* In some situations, modifying a file in the IDE followed by making or compiling the project would not build the modified file into the resulting binary (RSP-25509, RSP-25590)

This issue would result in the built binary (such as your app) running, but not including the changes since the last time it was run. For C++Builder, this could include source code changes, such as modifications in a .cpp file. For Delphi, this would not affect modifications to source (.pas) files, but might affect other files such as resource (.res) files.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

1. Shut down RAD Studio
2. Create a backup copy of the following files in your RAD Studio installation folder:
   1. bin\Borland.Build.Tasks.Shared.dll
3. Extract the ZIP archive
4. Unblock the extracted file if necessary (only needed if the file was extracted with Windows Explorer)
   1. Bring up the properties dialog by right clicking on the file and select Properties
   2. In the Security section at the bottom, check the Unblock checkbox to unblock the file
5. Copy the contents of the ZIP archive to the RAD Studio installation folder, so that the contents overwrite the 'Borland.Build.Tasks.Shared.dll' file in the \bin subfolder
6. Restart RAD Studio
