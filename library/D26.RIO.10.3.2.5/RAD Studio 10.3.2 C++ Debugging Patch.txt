RAD Studio 10.3.2 C++ Debugging Patch
================================================

This patch addresses the following issues:

* Debugging variables in apps built with the Classic bcc32 compiler could not be evaluated or watched (RSP-25943)

A previous hotfix, 'RAD Studio 10.3.2 C++ and Delphi Toolchain Patch' (August 14 2019), resolved a similar issue for the Win32 Clang-enhanced compiler, (RSP-25527.)

This hotfix resolves both issues such that variable evaluation is correct for both Win32 compilers. If you install both hotfixes, install this hotfix second.
